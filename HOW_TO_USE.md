# How to Use This Repository

This document explains how to navigate and learn from this repository effectively.

---

## 🧑‍🎓 If You Are a Learner

Follow this order:

### 1. Start with `/concepts`
Each concept is explained from first principles:
- What problem it solves
- Intuition before math
- Math when necessary
- Why it matters in real AI systems

Do not rush. Understanding matters more than coverage.

---

### 2. Move to `/code/from-scratch`
After understanding a concept:
- See how it is implemented from scratch
- Read the comments and logic carefully
- Modify and experiment on your own

The code prioritizes **clarity over cleverness**.

---

### 3. Read `/daily-posts`
This shows:
- What was studied on a given day
- What was implemented
- What insights were gained
- What questions remain

This is the most honest part of the repository.

---

### 4. Explore `/research-notes`
Here you will find:
- Paper breakdowns
- Interpretations beyond the paper
- Open questions
- Speculative ideas

This section reflects **research thinking**, not final answers.

---

## 🧪 If You Are an Advanced Reader or Researcher

- Jump directly to `research-notes/`
- Look at experiments in `code/experiments/`
- Use `ROADMAP.md` to see what topics are coming next
- Open discussions if you disagree or want to collaborate

---

## 🤝 If You Want to Contribute

Contributions are welcome, but quality matters.

A good contribution must:
- Explain the idea clearly
- Include references where applicable
- Avoid copy-paste content
- Prefer understanding over length

Low-effort or auto-generated content without review will not be accepted.

## 📖 How to Read This Repo Correctly

Think deeply.
Experiment freely.
Question everything.
