# Machine Learning — Research-Graded Project & Concept Repository

## Executive Summary

This repository is a **research-oriented, from-scratch machine learning knowledge base** focused on mathematical rigor, algorithmic understanding, empirical analysis, and system-level thinking. It is designed to demonstrate *how and why* machine learning models work—not merely how to use libraries.

Unlike typical ML project collections, this repository emphasizes:

* Mathematical foundations behind learning algorithms
* First-principles implementations
* Failure modes, trade-offs, and empirical behavior
* Long-term relevance for research, advanced internships, and AI startups

This work reflects a **research mindset**, not coursework or tutorial replication.
