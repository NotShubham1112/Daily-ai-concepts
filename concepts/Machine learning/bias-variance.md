# Bias–Variance Tradeoff

## 1. Problem This Solves
Why does more data not always help?

## 2. Intuition
- High bias → underfitting
- High variance → overfitting

## 3. Formal Decomposition
Error = Bias² + Variance + Noise

## 4. Why This Matters
- Model selection
- Regularization
- Architecture choice

## 5. Research Insight
Bias–variance appears in **systems**, not just models.

## 6. Next Concepts
- Regularization
