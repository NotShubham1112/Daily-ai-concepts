# Loss Functions (The Objective)

## 1. Problem This Solves
How do we quantify "wrong"?

## 2. Intuition
Loss measures how bad predictions are.

## 3. Examples
- MSE: regression
- Cross-entropy: classification

## 4. Mathematical Example
MSE = (y - ŷ)²

## 5. Why Loss Matters
The loss defines:
- What the model learns
- What it ignores

## 6. Research Insight
Bad loss → bad intelligence.

## 7. Next Concepts
- Gradient descent
