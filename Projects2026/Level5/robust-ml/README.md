# Robust & Trustworthy Machine Learning — Research-Oriented Topics (Level 5)

This module focuses on the ethical and safety aspects of AI, including model robustness against attacks, interpretability, and bias mitigation.

## 📌 Module Scope

- **Adversarial Robustness**: Implementing the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) to generate adversarial examples.
- **Model Interpretability**: Creating saliency maps to visualize which input features influence a model's decision.
- **Fairness & Bias**: Measuring Disparate Impact and Demographic Parity in model predictions.
