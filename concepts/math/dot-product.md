# Dot Product (Similarity Engine)

## 1. Problem This Solves
How do we measure similarity between two data points?

## 2. Intuition
Dot product measures alignment.
If two vectors point in similar directions, the value is high.

## 3. Mathematical Definition
For vectors a and b:

a · b = Σ aᵢbᵢ

## 4. Geometric Meaning
a · b = |a||b|cos(θ)

This connects similarity to angle.

## 5. Why This Matters in AI
- Attention mechanisms
- Recommendation systems
- Similarity search
- Classification boundaries

## 6. Key Insight
Modern AI is largely **vector similarity at scale**.

## 7. Next Concepts
- Cosine similarity
- Matrix multiplication
