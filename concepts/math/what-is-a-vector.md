# What Is a Vector? (AI Perspective)

## 1. Problem This Solves
AI models need a way to represent real-world information numerically.

## 2. Intuition
A vector is simply a list of numbers.
Each number represents a feature.

Example:
Height, weight, age → [170, 65, 22]

## 3. Mathematical View
A vector is an ordered collection of scalars:

v = [v₁, v₂, v₃, ..., vₙ]

## 4. Why Vectors Matter in AI
- Inputs to ML models are vectors
- Word embeddings are vectors
- Images are flattened into vectors
- Gradients are vectors

## 5. Common Misunderstanding
Vectors are not just arrows.
In AI, vectors represent **information**.

## 6. Next Concepts
- Vector magnitude
- Dot product
- Feature spaces
