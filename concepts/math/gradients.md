# Gradients (How Models Learn)

## 1. Problem This Solves
How does a model know how to improve?

## 2. Intuition
A gradient tells you:
"Which direction increases the value fastest?"

## 3. Mathematical Definition
Gradient = vector of partial derivatives

∇f = [∂f/∂x₁, ∂f/∂x₂, ...]

## 4. Why This Matters in AI
- Training neural networks
- Optimization
- Backpropagation

## 5. Core Insight
Learning = following gradients downhill.

## 6. Next Concepts
- Loss functions
- Gradient descent
