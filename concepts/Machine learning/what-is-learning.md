# What Does It Mean for a Model to Learn?

## 1. Common Confusion
Models do not "think".
They optimize.

## 2. Definition
Learning = minimizing error on data.

## 3. Formal View
Given:
- Data
- Model
- Loss function

Learning = argmin(loss)

## 4. Why This Matters
This reframes AI as:
Optimization + data + structure

## 5. Key Insight
There is no intelligence without an objective.

## 6. Next Concepts
- Loss functions
- Optimization algorithms
