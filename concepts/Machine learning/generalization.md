# Generalization (The Real Goal)

## 1. Definition
Generalization = performance on unseen data.

## 2. Why Training Accuracy Is Not Enough
Real AI systems operate on unknown inputs.

## 3. Key Factors
- Data distribution
- Model capacity
- Regularization

## 4. Research Insight
Generalization is still not fully understood.

## 5. Why This Matters in Modern AI
LLMs generalize through scale, not rules.

## 6. Next Concepts
- Scaling laws
- Model capacity
