# Matrices in AI

## 1. Problem This Solves
AI models need to transform many vectors at once.

## 2. Intuition
A matrix is a table of numbers.
It applies transformations to vectors.

## 3. Mathematical View
Matrix A ∈ ℝⁿˣᵐ transforms a vector x ∈ ℝᵐ into ℝⁿ.

## 4. Why Matrices Matter
- Neural network layers
- Linear transformations
- Attention weights
- Data batching

## 5. Important Insight
Training a neural network = learning good matrices.

## 6. Next Concepts
- Matrix multiplication
- Eigenvalues (later)
