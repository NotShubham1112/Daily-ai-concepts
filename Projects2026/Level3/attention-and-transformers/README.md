# Attention & Transformers — Deep Learning Foundations (Level 3)

This module implements **Attention Mechanisms and Transformers completely from scratch**, focusing on the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of modern sequence modeling.

All components — scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and the transformer block — are implemented using **NumPy only**, without relying on deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.

This module serves as the **bridge between sequence models (RNNs) and the modern Transformer era**.
