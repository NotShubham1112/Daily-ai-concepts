# Machine Learning Systems Design — ML Systems & Deployment (Level 6)

This module focuses on the engineering challenges of taking ML models from research to production, covering serving, monitoring, and tracking.

## 📌 Module Scope

- **Model Serving Architecture**: Demonstrating how models are wrapped in APIs for real-time inference.
- **Data Drift Detection**: Implementing statistical checks (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test logic) to identify changes in data distributions.
- **Experiment Tracking**: A lightweight system to log parameters, metrics, and model versions.
