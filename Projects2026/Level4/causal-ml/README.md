# Causal Machine Learning — Probabilistic & Advanced ML (Level 4)

This module implements **Causal Inference concepts**, distinguishing between correlation and causation through structural modeling and interventions.

## 📌 Module Scope

- **Causal Effect Estimation**: Implementing Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE).
- **Do-Calculus Simulator**: Simulating interventions in Structural Causal Models (SCMs).
- **Policy Impact Analysis**: Assessing the hypothetical impact of different interventions on a population.
