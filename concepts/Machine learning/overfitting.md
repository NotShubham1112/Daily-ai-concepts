# Overfitting

## 1. Problem This Solves
Why does a model perform well on training but fail in reality?

## 2. Intuition
Model memorizes instead of generalizing.

## 3. Causes
- Too complex
- Too little data
- No regularization

## 4. Why This Matters
Real-world failure is expensive.

## 5. Prevention
- More data
- Simpler models
- Regularization

## 6. Next Concepts
- L1 and L2 regularization
