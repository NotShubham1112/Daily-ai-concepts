# Agentic & Multi-Agent Systems — ML Systems & Deployment (Level 6)

This module implements key components of **autonomous agents**, focusing on memory management, reasoning/planning loops, and collaborative multi-agent environments.

## 📌 Module Scope

- **Agent Memory**: Implementing short-term and long-term memory buffers for context retention.
- **Planning Engines**: Demonstrating the ReAct (Reason + Act) loop for break-down of complex tasks.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Modeling communication and task delegation between specialized agents.
