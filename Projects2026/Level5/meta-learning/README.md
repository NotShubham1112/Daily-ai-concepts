# Meta-Learning & AutoML — Research-Oriented Topics (Level 5)

This module focuses on "learning to learn" and the automation of machine learning pipelines, including hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search.

## 📌 Module Scope

- **Meta-Learning (MAML)**: Understanding the logic of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for rapid adaptation.
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Implementing a conceptual surrogate model (Gaussian Process) approach to hyperparameter tuning.
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Demonstrating how models can generalize from very few examples.
